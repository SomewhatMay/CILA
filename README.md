# CILA

This Repository contains all the CILA versions released to the PUBLIC that can be run using lua 5.1.

This Repository only includes CILA Versions 3.2 and under. 

The next public release will be CILA 4.0 but will only be available on ROBLOX; It wont be able to run on repl.it or Lua 5.1.

There is a small chance I will publish a 3.x later, but chances are I wont.

*I do not own repl.it, Lua.org, or Lua.*
